### ! What is kanban ?
````
> Kanban is the Japanese word for “card”. In Toyota, assembly line workers used cards to communicate when they needed something from another department or process. This helped them reduce waste and increase their process efficiency. Kanban provides a visual for both the workflow and the actual work that goes through the workflow. Ever since its creation, it has helped organizations identify potential issues and bottlenecks in the workflow, allowing them to resolve the issue and let work flow efficiently at an optimal pace or throughput.

### What is personal kanban ?

>Personal Kanban is a lightweight and simple system to manage your professional tasks as well as personal kanban life tasks. The concept has been popularized by productivity experts Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry in their book, Personal Kanban: Mapping Work | Navigating Life. Adapting the Kanban concept to personal life, the goals of Personal Kanban are to help you focus on the things that you should be doing and controlling the amount of work you take on at one time.

Personal Kanban has two rules:

1. Visualize your work
2. Limit Work in Progress

These are the first two rules of kanban. Want to read more rules.<br>
